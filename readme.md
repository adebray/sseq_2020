In August 2020, [Richard Wong](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/richard.wong/) and I ([Arun
Debray](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/a.debray/)) are teaching a week-long online minicourse on an introduction
to spectral sequences. We plan to focus on examples rather than theory, taking for granted the existence of these
spectral sequences and using them to compute interesting things. As both of us are algebraic topologists, our
examples will primary be motivated from algebraic topology.

The purpose of this repo is to contain lecture notes and exercises for this minicourse.

Here's a provisional schedule:
	- Monday
		* what is a spectral sequence?
		* the Serre spectral sequence for a fibration
		* multiplicative structurs and why they're neat
	- Tuesday
		* additional Serre spectral sequence examples coming from group cohomology
		* the homotopy fixed-points spectral sequence
	- Wednesday
		* the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
		* Steenrod squares and differentials in the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
	- Thursday
		* comparison maps between spectral sequences and examples
		* comparing between homotopy fixed-points and Tate spectral sequences; the Greenlees spectral sequence
		* other useful and less-known tricks
	- Friday
		* the Adams spectral sequence over ùìê(1)
		* Margolis' theorem
		* algebraic structure on E2-page and use in extension questions
