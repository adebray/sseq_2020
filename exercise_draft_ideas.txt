Serre: compute the mod 2 cohomology of the Wu manifold W := SU(3)/SO(3).
	...challenge version: compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes of W. (Answer: w2 and w3 are nontrivial).
	How do you do this? Well, see this absolutely wild math.SX answer:
	https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/581401/computing-characteristic-numbers-of-homogeneous-spaces.
	Point is: determine maximal elementary abelian 2-groups inside SO(3) and SU(3), then use this and maps between
	Serre SSes to figure out SW classes. Maybe this is a good Day 4 problem (using functoriality of spectral
	sequences).

Adams over A(1): up to dim 7, what are the reduced spin bordism groups of the Wu manifold?
	1. determine Steenrod operations using prev calc of SW classes + Wu formula (remind people of Wu formula)
	2. hey, that's the question mark! cool. (incidentally, this gives a really easy realization of the qn mark
	   complex). So determine its Ext somehow, probably an LES.

	also a good example if people care about ku-theory or spinc bordism.

Adams over A(1): let T be the Thom space of the virtual bundle (2taut - 2) -> RP^\infty. Exhibit a 2-local
isomorphism ko smash T -> \bigoplus_{i=0}^\infty \Sigma^{4i} HZ.
(answer: see http://www.rrb.wayne.edu/papers/osac2.pdf. Studying this with the Adams spectral sequence, we get
h0-towers in nonnegative degrees 0 mod 4, so the groups match. The actual map comes by picking coh classes in those
degrees)

Adams over A(1): have we developed enough to prove anything like Wood's thm ko smash Ceta = ku?

Day 4: just an idea, but can we compute the K-groups of lens spaces as follows?
	1. run the Serre SS for S^1 -> L(k, n) -> CP^n. Using what we already know geometrically, infer some
	   differentials.
	2. Consider the map on Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences induced by KU -> HZ (which we
	   presumably know on S^1 and CP^\infty?) to infer that differential back to the lens space?
	Haven't thought through whether this will work well. Would be crucial to use reduced K-theory of S^1 to make
	this simpler (does that work??)
	Update: this works for ku, because we have a map ku -> HZ, but idk about KU. Still a good example: you use the
	map of LSAH SSeqs to get d2, and thenit collapses on E3. The only question left is whether the multiplicative
	structure resolves all extension problems, and I think this is a bit too nice to be true.
